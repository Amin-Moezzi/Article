# Set Up Virtual Environment
   I create  a Virtual Environment for my project to isolate dependencies
   of my project, it allows me to manage and install Python packages separately
   from the system-wide Python installation. This is especially useful for managing
   dependencies for different projects without conflicts.

``` code
cmd
pip install virtualenv

python3 -m venv venv
```
### Activating the Virtual Environment On Windows
``` cmd
`venv\Scripts\activate`
```
Once activated, the virtual environment's name appears in the terminal prompt.

To deactivate and return to the global Python environment:
```
deactivate
```

### Set Up Database
Run migrations to set up the database:
```cmd 
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the Development Server
Run the server to start the application:
```
cmd
python manage.py runserver
```
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to view the application.
